<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Unbelievable Scenes + Brad Pitt, so you know it will be amazing!</p>
<h3>Se7en</h3>
<p>A mind-boggling movie with an unexpected twist of events that keeps you on your toes. One of my favourite parts of the movie was when Brad Pitt said: <br />
"What's in the box..? Tell me what's in the box!" 
</p>
<h3>The Great Wall</h3>
<p>2 American wanderers become allies of the Chinese to face the foretold legend of an attack by exotic space monsters.</p>
